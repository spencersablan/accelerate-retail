            <h2>Accelerate Retail Partners Selected by GlobalGiving As Red Backpack Fund Recipient, Receives $5,000
                Grant From The Spanx by Sara Blakely Foundation To Combat COVID-19 Crisis</h2>
            <p><em>October 29, 2020</em> — GlobalGiving announced today that Accelerate Retail Partners has been
                selected to receive a $5,000 COVID-19 relief and recovery grant from The Red Backpack Fund, an
                opportunity for small businesses and nonprofits made possible by The Spanx by Sara Blakely
                Foundation.<br><br>
                “My hope is that this gift will help alleviate some of the pressures caused by this horrible pandemic.
                Twenty years ago, I started Spanx with $5,000 in savings, and I see this as a time to pay it forward.
                Small business is the backbone of our culture. I know what it’s like to be a small business owner, and I
                want to provide some relief to these entrepreneurs during this time,” said Spanx Founder Sara
                Blakely.<br><br>
                The Spanx by Sara Blakely Foundation donated $5 million to support female entrepreneurs in the wake of
                COVID-19 and teamed up with GlobalGiving to establish The Red Backpack Fund.<br><br>
                Thousands of business owners and nonprofit founders from across the United States and its territories
                applied to receive a grant from The Red Backpack Fund to combat economic hardship caused by COVID-19.
                Accelerate Retail Partners was selected for the grant based on its outstanding application, its urgent
                need for COVID-19 relief, and its demonstrated capacity to overcome COVID-19
                setbacks.<br><br>GlobalGiving, a 501(c)(3) organization with nearly two decades of grantmaking
                experience, will award grants to at least 1,000 women entrepreneurs from now through September 2020
                through The Red Backpack Fund. GlobalGiving has assembled a 100% women-led team to lead the grantee
                selection process. The team includes grant specialists, social workers, female entrepreneurs, analysts,
                and monitoring and evaluation experts.
                <br><br>"We're proud to announce the grantees of The Red Backpack Fund. They have successfully undergone
                GlobalGiving’s rigorous vetting process, and we believe this grant will help them continue to thrive,
                despite the shifting economic circumstances brought on by this crisis," said GlobalGiving CEO Alix
                Guerrier. "The world needs more women-led organizations who are a key force in overcoming COVID-19 and
                establishing a better normal."<br><br>Learn more about The Red Backpack Fund at <a

                <strong>About The Spanx by Sara Blakely Foundation</strong><br>Since its inception in 2006, the Spanx by
                Sara Blakely Foundation has donated millions to charities around the world, focusing on charities that
                empower underserved women and girls. In 2013, Sara Blakely became the first self-made, female
                billionaire to sign the Giving Pledge, created by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett, promising
                to give at least half her wealth to charity. In 2020, Sara and the Spanx by Sara Blakely Foundation
                launched the Red Backpack Fund in partnership with GlobalGiving. Back by Sara Blakely, the $5 million
                fund supports the recovery and revitalization of female-owned businesses in the U.S. impacted by the
                coronavirus crisis. While many of the world’s resources are being depleted, one is waiting to be
                unleashed: Women. The Spanx by Sara Blakely Foundation is on a mission to support women and help them
                SOAR through education, entrepreneurship and the arts. Learn more at <a
